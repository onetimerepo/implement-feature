# Requirements
All the following tasks can be done without adding any other dependencies

# Step 1
Fix the sortMyString method so all Unit Tests pass
Fix removeDuplicatesFromList method so all Unit Tests pass

# Step 2
Make the application a SpringBoot Webapp
I should be able to call sortMyString and removeDuplicatesFromList, from a REST, JSON based endpoint
All Dependencies are already added to the pom.xml, there is no need to add more
Create a new Controller class outside of the application.java class and call the methods from that controller

Both REST Endpoints 
- Should be able to have an input string passed via JSON
- Result is print in JSON format
